Polio, a highly contagious viral infection, left her with a noticeable limp in her right leg, a constant reminder of her physical vulnerability. This early experience with illness and disability not only affected Kahlo's mobility but also had a profound psychological impact on her self-esteem and sense of identity. Growing up with a visible disability in a society that often stigmatized and marginalized those who were different, Kahlo struggled to find acceptance and belonging.</p>

Throughout her life, Kahlo grappled with feelings of inadequacy and insecurity stemming from her disability, yet she also found strength and empowerment in embracing her unique perspective and lived experience. Her art became a means of reclaiming her body and asserting her agency, challenging societal norms and redefining beauty on her own terms.</p>
            <p>In her self-portraits, Kahlo often depicted her physical disabilities with unflinching honesty, refusing to conceal or minimize her limp or other bodily imperfections.
